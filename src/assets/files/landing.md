My name is Daniel Connell. I prototype and develop basic technologies which anyone can make using recycled materials and simple tools.

The aim is for everyone everywhere to be able to build and maintain their own infrastructure; producing their own energy, food, clean water, communications, and anything else they need.

All designs are open source and license free for any purpose, and full construction tutorials and how-tos are available here.

The [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/opensourcelowtech/) is also a good place to ask questions and post results from your own builds.
